Some of the icons come from "Matthias Pfefferle's Microformat icon set":http://notizblog.org/projects/microformats-icons/. This extension wouldn't be *pretty* without these awesome little icons. The recipe icon comes from the MealKeeper set which can be found at "deviantart.com":http://shlyapnikova.deviantart.com/art/Icon-for-MealKeeper-s-soft-162435451
